# Java Pattern Printing Examples

This repository contains a collection of Java programs demonstrating various pattern printing techniques using nested loops. These examples cover a wide range of patterns,
from simple geometric shapes to more complex structures involving numbers and binary representations.  This repository is a valuable resource for learning about loop control,
conditional statements, and algorithmic thinking in Java.

This repository includes Java source files for the following patterns:

*   palindronic pyramid:  A pyramid pattern where each row forms a palindrome.
*   pattern binary: A pattern using binary digits (0s and 1s).
*   pattern butterfly: A symmetrical butterfly-shaped pattern.
*   pattern diamond: A diamond-shaped pattern.
*   pattern no count reset: (Please provide a description or code snippet for this pattern so I can document it properly)
*   pattern number 2: (Please provide a description or code snippet for this pattern so I can document it properly)
*   pattern rhombus: A rhombus-shaped pattern.
*   pattern solid rectangle: A filled rectangle pattern.
*   pattern using numbers reverse: A pattern using numbers in reverse order.
*   pattern using numbers: A pattern using numbers in a specific sequence.
*   patterns hollow rectangle: A rectangle with only the border printed.
*   patterns triangle binary numbers: A triangle pattern using binary numbers.
*   patterns triangle reverse inverted: An inverted triangle with its sides reversed.
*   patterns triangle reverse: A triangle pattern with its rows reversed.
*   patterns triangle: A standard triangle pattern.
